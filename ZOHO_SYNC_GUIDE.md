# Zoho Lead Sync - Complete Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **Option 2: Auto-Sync with Manual Refresh (Best Practice)**

Your Zoho integration now has:
1. ✅ **Database Storage** - Leads stored in MongoDB
2. ✅ **Auto Background Sync** - Syncs every 30 minutes
3. ✅ **Manual Sync Button** - Force refresh anytime
4. ✅ **Search & Filter** - Find leads quickly
5. ✅ **Stats Dashboard** - See lead metrics
6. ✅ **Status Tracking** - Track lead progress
7. ✅ **Portal Signup Push** - New portal users create/update Zoho Leads
8. ✅ **Admin → Zoho Updates** - Status, assignment, and notes sync back

---

## 🚀 How to Enable Auto-Sync

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable

In your `backend/.env` file, add:

```env
# Zoho Auto-Sync (set to 'true' to enable)
ZOHO_AUTO_SYNC=true

# Existing Zoho credentials (keep these)
ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
```

Optional two-way sync settings:

```env
# Lead source + status for portal signups
ZOHO_PORTAL_LEAD_SOURCE=Portal Signup
ZOHO_PORTAL_LEAD_STATUS=new

# Optional: map admin assignments to a custom Zoho field
# (set to the API name of your custom field)
ZOHO_ASSIGN_FIELD_API_NAME=Assigned_To

# Optional: use "email" (default) or "name" when syncing assignment
ZOHO_ASSIGN_FIELD_VALUE=email

# Optional: override Zoho lead status labels
ZOHO_STATUS_NEW=Not Contacted
ZOHO_STATUS_CONTACTED=Contacted
ZOHO_STATUS_QUALIFIED=Qualified
ZOHO_STATUS_CONVERTED=Converted
ZOHO_STATUS_LOST=Lost Lead

# Optional: default Company value if Zoho requires it
ZOHO_DEFAULT_COMPANY=Individual
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

You'll see in console:
```
Server running on port 5000
[Zoho Sync] Starting background sync...
[Zoho Sync] Completed: 25 total (5 new, 20 updated)
[Zoho Sync] Started - will sync every 30 minutes
```

---

## 📊 How It Works

### **Automatic Sync Flow:**

```
Server Starts → Immediate Sync → Store in DB → 
Wait 30 min → Sync Again → Update DB → Repeat Forever
```

### **Manual Sync Flow:**

```
Admin clicks "Sync Now" → Fetch from Zoho → 
Update DB → Refresh UI → Show stats
```

### **Two-Way Sync Flow (New):**

```
Portal signup → Create/Update Zoho Lead → Upsert local lead
Admin updates (status/assignment/notes) → Update Zoho → Save locally
Zoho edits (webhook or scheduled sync) → Update local lead
```

### **What Gets Synced:**
- Lead Name
- Email
- Phone
- Company
- Lead Source
- Created Time
- Status (new/contacted/qualified/converted/lost)

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Sync Not Working?

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   echo $ZOHO_AUTO_SYNC
   echo $ZOHO_CLIENT_ID
   ```

2. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for `[Zoho Sync]` messages
   - Check for error messages

3. **Test Manual Sync**
   - Go to `/admin/zoho-leads`
   - Click "Sync Now"
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Verify Zoho Credentials**
   - Test with: `GET /api/zoho/leads`
   - Should return leads if credentials valid

### No Leads Showing?
