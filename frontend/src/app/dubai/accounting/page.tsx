            <ContentSection title="Who This Service Is For">
                <p>Our accounting services in Dubai are for any Mainland or Free Zone company that needs to ensure compliance with the UAE's evolving financial regulations. This is critical for businesses registering for VAT, preparing for the 9% Corporate Tax, and for companies in free zones like DMCC or JAFZA that require mandatory annual audits for license renewal. It is designed for founders who need reliable financial data for decision-making and peace of mind on compliance.</p>

             <ContentSection title="When It Is Required">
                <p>Under UAE law, maintaining proper accounting records is mandatory from the day of incorporation. Professional accounting becomes non-negotiable when your business registers for VAT or Corporate Tax, as accurate records are required for tax filings. Furthermore, it is essential when preparing the audited financial statements required by many free zone authorities for annual trade license renewal.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Cost Ranges in Dubai (UAE)">
                <p>Outsourcing your accounting provides access to professional expertise at a predictable monthly cost, far lower than hiring an in-house accountant. Typical costs in the UAE are:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Small Businesses / Low Transaction Volume:** AED 1,500 – AED 3,000 per month.</li>
                    <li>**Growing Companies or those requiring regular reporting:** AED 3,000 – AED 7,500 per month.</li>
                    <li>**Annual Audit Fees (if applicable):** Separate from monthly accounting, these typically range from AED 5,000 to AED 15,000+.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Compliance Risks">
                <p>Improper accounting in the UAE can lead to severe financial and operational consequences:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**FTA Penalties:** The Federal Tax Authority imposes significant fines for incorrect or late VAT and Corporate Tax filings.</li>
                    <li>**Failed Audits:** Inaccurate books will lead to a qualified or adverse opinion on your audit report, which can prevent your trade license renewal.</li>
                    <li>**Inability to Renew License:** Many free zones will not renew a company's license without submission of compliant, audited financial statements.</li>
                    <li>**Bank Account Freezing:** Banks may freeze accounts of companies that are not in good legal standing due to non-compliance.</li>
                </ul>
