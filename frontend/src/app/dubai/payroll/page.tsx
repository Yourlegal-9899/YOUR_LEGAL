             <ContentSection title="When It Is Required">
                <p>A compliant payroll process is required from the moment you hire your first employee. Companies must register with the Wages Protection System (WPS), a mandatory electronic salary transfer system that ensures employees are paid correctly and on time.</p>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Cost Ranges">
                <p>UAE payroll services are generally affordable and often included as part of a broader accounting package.</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Per Employee, Per Month:** AED 50 – AED 150.</li>
                    <li>**Bundled with Accounting:** Often included in monthly accounting retainers starting from AED 1,500 – AED 3,000 per month.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Compliance Risks">
                <p>Non-compliance with UAE payroll regulations can be costly:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**WPS Violations:** Failure to pay salaries through WPS can lead to fines and a block on issuing new work permits.</li>
                    <li>**Incorrect Gratuity Calculation:** Miscalculating end-of-service benefits is a common cause of employee disputes and legal claims.</li>
                    <li>**Labor Law Fines:** The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) can impose fines for various breaches of the labour law.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

             <ContentSection title="Why Outsourcing Works Better">
                <p>Although the UAE has no income tax, its Labour Law has specific and strict rules regarding payment timing, leave calculation, and end-of-service gratuity. Outsourcing to YourLegal ensures your payroll is fully compliant with the WPS, all calculations are accurate, and your business is protected from potential employee disputes and government penalties through our expert payroll services in Dubai.</p>
