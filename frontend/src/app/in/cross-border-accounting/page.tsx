                <p>Cross-border accounting is a critical service for Indian companies that are part of a global financial network.

             <ContentSection title="When It Is Required">
                <p>Cross-Border Accounting Services in India is required the moment your business engages in a financial transaction with a party outside of India. It is especially critical when receiving foreign investment (FDI), which triggers mandatory reporting to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). It is also essential when you have inter-company transactions, which are subject to India's detailed Transfer Pricing regulations.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Cost Ranges in India">
                <p>Cross-border accounting is a highly specialized field in India, and the pricing reflects the deep expertise required to navigate its complex regulatory framework. Costs are customized to your business's global footprint:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Moderate Complexity (e.g., managing FDI reporting, withholding tax):** Starting from ₹50,000 – ₹1,20,000 per month.</li>
                    <li>**High Complexity (e.g., detailed transfer pricing study, group consolidation):** Starting from ₹1,20,000 – ₹3,00,000+ per month.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Compliance Risks">
                <p>Mismanaging cross-border finances in India carries severe regulatory risks:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**FEMA/RBI Penalties:** Failure to report foreign investment (FDI) or overseas investment (ODI) within the prescribed timelines can lead to significant penalties, which can be a percentage of the amount involved.</li>
                    <li>**Transfer Pricing Adjustments:** The Indian tax authorities are extremely aggressive on transfer pricing. If they determine that your inter-company transactions are not at "arm's length," they can make large tax adjustments, leading to heavy tax demands and penalties.</li>
                    <li>**Withholding Tax (TDS) Violations:** Failure to withhold the correct tax on payments made to non-residents for services can result in the expense being disallowed for tax purposes, plus penalties and interest.</li>
                    <li>**Double Taxation:** Without proper application of India's tax treaties, your company's profits could be taxed both in India and in a foreign country, significantly eroding your profitability.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

             <ContentSection title="Why Outsourcing Works Better">
