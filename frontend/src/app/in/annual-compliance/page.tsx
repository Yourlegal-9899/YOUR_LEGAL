             <ContentSection title="When It Is Required">
                <p>Annual compliance is a year-round activity culminating in the filings after the financial year-end (March 31st). Key deadlines include holding an Annual General Meeting (AGM) within 6 months of the financial year-end, and filing the Annual Return (Form MGT-7) and audited Financial Statements (Form AOC-4) with the MCA shortly after.</p>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Cost Ranges">
                <p>Annual compliance costs are typically bundled into a single package covering all secretarial and filing services for the year:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Annual Compliance Retainer:** ₹15,000 – ₹40,000+ per year.</li>
                    <li>**This package usually includes:** Preparation of AGM minutes and resolutions, maintenance of statutory registers, and filing of all necessary forms with the MCA. Government filing fees are additional but minimal. Statutory audit fees are separate.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Compliance Risks">
                <p>Failure to comply with MCA annual filing requirements has severe consequences:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Heavy Penalties:** The MCA imposes a penalty of ₹100 per day, per form, for late filings, with no upper limit.</li>
                    <li>**Director Disqualification:** Directors of a company that fails to file for three consecutive years can be disqualified and barred from holding a directorship in any company for five years.</li>
                    <li>**Company Strike-Off:** The MCA can strike the company's name from the register, causing it to cease to exist legally and its bank account to be frozen.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

             <ContentSection title="Why Outsourcing Works Better">
                <p>Under Indian law, MCA filings must be certified by a practicing professional (like a Company Secretary or Chartered Accountant). Therefore, outsourcing is not just a best practice; it is a legal necessity. YourLegal provides a dedicated compliance team to manage all your corporate secretarial duties, track deadlines, and ensure all MCA filings are accurate and on time, protecting your company and its directors from the severe consequences of non-compliance.</p>
