                <p>Under the Indian Companies Act, 2013, every company is required to maintain proper books of account from its date of incorporation. Bookkeeping is the fundamental process that enables all other financial compliance, including monthly GST returns, quarterly TDS returns, and the preparation of annual financial statements for the statutory audit and income tax filing.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Compliance Risks">
                <p>Poor or neglected bookkeeping in India creates a domino effect of compliance issues:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Incorrect GST Filings:** Leads to mismatches in input tax credit (ITC) and notices from the GST department, resulting in penalties and interest.</li>
                    <li>**TDS Defaults:** Failure to deduct or deposit TDS on time results in interest and penalties.</li>
                    <li>**Inaccurate Financial Statements:** Prevents a clean audit report and can lead to penalties from the MCA.</li>
                    <li>**Increased Year-End Fees:** Your Chartered Accountant will charge significantly more to clean up a year's worth of messy books before they can conduct the audit or file taxes.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>
