             <ContentSection title="When It Is Required">
                <p>Under UK law, every limited company is required to keep accurate accounting records from the day it is incorporated. Bookkeeping is the fundamental process that enables all other financial compliance. It is required for filing your quarterly VAT returns, preparing your annual statutory accounts for Companies House, and calculating your profit for your annual Corporation Tax return to HMRC. Without it, you cannot meet your legal obligations. Our professional bookkeeping services ensure this is done efficiently and correctly.</p>

                <p>Poor bookkeeping is a common source of business stress and compliance issues. The risks include:</p>

                    <li>**Incorrect VAT Returns:** Leading to penalties from HMRC for underpayment of VAT and complications with Making Tax Digital.</li>
                    <li>**Tax Audit Triggers:** Messy and unreconciled books are a major red flag for HMRC.</li>
                    <li>**Missed Tax Deductions:** Failure to correctly categorise all legitimate business expenses results in a higher Corporation Tax bill.</li>
                    <li>**Increased Year-End Accounting Fees:** If your books are disorganized, your accountant will have to charge a significantly higher fee to clean them up before they can prepare your annual accounts.</li>
                </ul>
