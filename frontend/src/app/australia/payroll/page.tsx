                <p>Our Payroll Services in Australia are for any Australian company with employees. It's crucial for businesses that need to navigate the complexities of modern awards, Pay As You Go (PAYG) tax withholding, and the mandatory Superannuation Guarantee contributions required under Australian law.</p>
            </ContentSection>
            
             <ContentSection title="When It Is Required">
                <p>A payroll system is required as soon as you hire your first employee. You must register for PAYG withholding with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and set up a compliant system for making superannuation contributions. All payroll information must also be reported to the ATO via Single Touch Payroll (STP) on or before each payday.</p>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Cost Ranges">
                <p>Outsourced Payroll Services in Australia are typically priced on a per-employee basis:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Base Fee:** A$20 – A$50 per month.</li>
                    <li>**Per-Employee Fee:** A$5 – A$15 per employee, per month.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-4">This usually includes STP filing, payslip generation, and superannuation processing.</p>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Compliance Risks">
                <p>Payroll errors in Australia carry significant risks:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**ATO Penalties:** Heavy fines for failing to report via Single Touch Payroll or for incorrect PAYG withholding.</li>
                    <li>**Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC):** A punitive charge, including interest and fees, for failing to pay the correct superannuation amount on time. This charge is not tax-deductible.</li>
                    <li>**Fair Work Act Violations:** Breaches of employment awards can lead to back-pay claims and large fines from the Fair Work Ombudsman.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

             <ContentSection title="Why Outsourcing Works Better">
                <p>Australian payroll is notoriously complex due to the interplay of tax law, superannuation regulations, and industrial awards. Outsourcing Payroll Services in Australia to YourLegal ensures that PAYG is calculated correctly, mandatory superannuation is paid on time, and all STP reporting to the ATO is handled automatically. This mitigates significant financial and legal risks for your business.</p>
