             <ContentSection title="When It Is Required">
                <p>Professional accounting is necessary from the moment your business begins to have significant financial activity. It is legally required for preparing annual financial statements for ASIC (if applicable), filing company tax returns with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), and managing your Goods and Services Tax (GST) obligations through Business Activity Statements (BAS). It becomes indispensable when seeking investment, applying for loans, or planning for growth.</p>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Cost Ranges in Australia">
                <p>The cost of outsourced accounting in Australia is scalable and provides exceptional value compared to hiring an in-house accountant. Typical monthly costs are:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Startups and Small Businesses:** AUD $500 – $1,200 per month for core accounting and BAS lodgement.</li>
                    <li>**Growing Companies:** AUD $1,200 – $3,000 per month for more complex needs, including management reporting and forecasting.</li>
                    <li>**Multi-entity or Complex Operations:** Custom pricing based on specific requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-4">By outsourcing Accounting Services in Australia to YourLegal, businesses can reduce their overall finance and administration costs by up to 60%, freeing up capital for growth-oriented activities.</p>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Compliance Risks">
                <p>Inaccurate or non-compliant accounting in Australia poses significant risks that can disrupt your business and lead to financial penalties:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**ATO Audits and Penalties:** Incorrect income tax or BAS filings can trigger costly audits and penalties from the ATO.</li>
                    <li>**ASIC Non-Compliance:** Failure to maintain proper financial records is a breach of the Corporations Act and can lead to director penalties.</li>
                    <li>**Poor Financial Visibility:** Inaccurate reporting leads to flawed business decisions, poor cash flow management, and an inability to secure funding.</li>
                    <li>**Investor Distrust:** Investors require timely and accurate financial reports. Failing to provide them can damage credibility and hinder fundraising efforts.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>
