            <ContentSection title="Compliance Risks">
                <p>Managing international finances without expert guidance is fraught with risk. Key dangers for Australian businesses include:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Transfer Pricing Violations:** The ATO heavily scrutinises transactions between related international entities. Incorrect pricing can lead to significant tax adjustments and penalties.</li>
                    <li>**Foreign Exchange (FX) Volatility:** Improperly managed currency fluctuations can erase profits and distort financial reporting.</li>
                    <li>**International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Compliance:** Failure to reconcile accounts under both Australian standards (AASB) and IFRS can lead to audit failures and issues with foreign partners.</li>
                    <li>**Double Taxation:** Without proper structuring and use of tax treaties, your company could pay tax on the same income in multiple countries, severely impacting profitability.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

             <ContentSection title="Why Outsourcing Works Better">
