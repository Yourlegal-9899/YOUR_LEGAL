              For founders, especially those outside the US, tax compliance is one of the most intimidating aspects of running an American company. The system is multi-layered, the forms are complex, and the penalties for non-compliance are severe. However, with a systematic approach, it is entirely manageable.

              This checklist provides a clear, step-by-step framework for your company's annual tax obligations. Following it is the key to avoiding IRS penalties, maintaining your company's good standing, and operating with peace of mind.

                <ChecklistItem title="Step 1: Finalize Your Bookkeeping">
                  Your tax return is only as accurate as your books. Before any tax work can begin, your bookkeeping for the financial year (typically ending Dec 31) must be complete and accurate. This means all income and expenses have been recorded and categorized, and all bank accounts have been reconciled. This is the bedrock of compliance. A professional <Link href="/usa/bookkeeping" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">bookkeeping service</Link> is essential here.
                </ChecklistItem>
                
                <ChecklistItem title="Step 2: File Federal Income Tax Returns">
                    Every US company must file an annual income tax return with the IRS, even if it had no income. The form you file depends on your entity type:
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>C-Corporations:</strong> File <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Form 1120</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multi-Member LLCs (taxed as partnerships):</strong> File <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Form 1065</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Single-Member LLCs (disregarded entities):</strong> The activity is reported on the owner's personal tax return. However, if owned by a non-resident, a separate filing is required (see next step).</li>
                    </ul>
                </ChecklistItem>

                <ChecklistItem title="Step 3: File Mandatory Informational Returns (Critical for Foreign Owners)">
                     These returns don't typically involve a tax payment but are mandatory and carry severe penalties for non-compliance.
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Form 5472:</strong> Required for any 25% foreign-owned US corporation or a foreign-owned US LLC. It must be filed with a pro-forma Form 1120. The penalty for failure to file is a staggering **$25,000**. This is covered in depth in our <Link href="/blog/non-resident-tax-guide" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Non-Resident Tax Guide</Link>.</li>
                        <li><strong>FBAR (FinCEN Form 114):</strong> Required if your US company has signature authority over foreign bank accounts with a combined balance over $10,000.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ChecklistItem>

                <ChecklistItem title="Step 4: Meet State-Level Filing Obligations">
                    Compliance doesn't end with the IRS. You must also satisfy the requirements of your state of incorporation and any state where you do business.
                     <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Annual Report:</strong> Most states require an annual report to update company information.</li>
                        <li><strong>Franchise Tax:</strong> States like Delaware and Texas levy a franchise tax, which is a fee for the privilege of being incorporated there. This is due even with no income.</li>
                        <li><strong>State Income Tax:</strong> If your company has nexus and income in a state with corporate income tax, you must file a state-level tax return.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Our <Link href="/usa/annual-compliance" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Annual Compliance service</Link> handles these state filings automatically.
                </ChecklistItem>

                 <ChecklistItem title="Step 5: Manage Sales Tax Obligations">
                    If you sell goods or certain services in the US, you may have an obligation to collect and remit sales tax. This is determined by "sales tax nexus," which can be triggered by having a physical presence or exceeding economic thresholds in a state. Managing this across 50 states is complex and typically requires specialized software and services.
                </ChecklistItem>

                <ChecklistItem title="Step 6: Pay Estimated Taxes">
                    If your business expects to owe $500 or more in tax for the year, you are generally required to make estimated tax payments to the IRS on a quarterly basis. The deadlines are typically April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15 of the following year.
