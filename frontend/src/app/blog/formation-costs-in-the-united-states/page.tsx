              Budgeting is critical for any new venture. When forming a US company, founders need a clear understanding of not just the initial setup cost, but also the recurring annual expenses required to keep the company legally active. These costs can be broken down into three main categories: one-time state filing fees, annual recurring state fees, and professional service fees.

             <p className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
             This guide provides a transparent breakdown of these costs, focusing on the two most popular states for non-resident founders: <Link href="/blog/delaware-vs-wyoming-incorporation" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Delaware and Wyoming</Link>.

                    <li><strong>Formation Service Fee:</strong> A one-time fee for preparing and filing your documents, obtaining your EIN, and providing legal templates. Our package starts at $499, which is significantly more cost-effective than hiring a traditional law firm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Registered Agent Fee:</strong> A mandatory annual cost for having a registered agent in your state of formation. This service is typically $100-$200 per year. **Your first year is included in our formation package.**</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual Compliance/Tax Service Fee:</strong> An annual fee for preparing and filing your state Annual Report and federal/state tax returns.
