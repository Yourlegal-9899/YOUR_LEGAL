              Setting up payroll for the first time is a major milestone that officially turns your startup into an employer. It's also a process that must be done correctly to avoid significant legal and tax penalties down the road. While using a professional payroll provider is a must, you still need to complete several foundational steps to get started.

              This checklist outlines the critical steps every US company must take before running its first payroll.
            </p>

            <BlogSection title="Your 6-Step Payroll Setup Checklist" icon={CheckSquare}>
                <ChecklistItem title="Step 1: Obtain Your Tax Identification Numbers" icon={Landmark}>
                  You cannot run payroll without being registered as an employer. This requires two key numbers:
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN):</strong> If you don't already have one from forming your company, you must obtain one from the IRS. It's the master ID for all federal tax purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>State Payroll Tax IDs:</strong> You must register with the tax department of the state where your employee works. This will give you state-level account numbers for withholding and unemployment taxes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ChecklistItem>
                
                <ChecklistItem title="Step 2: Choose a Payroll Provider" icon={Users}>
                    Do not attempt to do payroll manually. The risk of error is too high. Choose a reputable payroll provider like Gusto, Rippling, or ADP. They will handle all tax calculations, payments, and filings. YourLegal's <Link href="/usa/payroll" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">payroll service</Link> helps you get set up with these leading providers.
                </ChecklistItem>

                <ChecklistItem title="Step 3: Select a Pay Schedule" icon={FileText}>
                    Decide how often you will pay your employees. Common schedules in the US are:
                     <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> 52 pay periods per year.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bi-weekly (every two weeks):</strong> 26 pay periods per year. This is the most common schedule.</li>
                        <li><strong>Semi-monthly (twice a month, e.g., 15th and last day):</strong> 24 pay periods per year.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> 12 pay periods per year.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Your state may have laws dictating the minimum pay frequency.
                </ChecklistItem>

                <ChecklistItem title="Step 4: Gather Employee Information" icon={FileText}>
                    For each new W-2 employee, you must collect the following before their first payday:
                     <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Form W-4:</strong> This form tells you the employee's tax filing status and how much federal income tax to withhold.</li>
                        <li><strong>Form I-9:</strong> This form verifies the employee's identity and eligibility to work in the US. You must physically or virtually inspect their identification documents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bank Account Details:</strong> For setting up direct deposit.</li>
                        <li><strong>State-Specific Forms:</strong> Some states have their own withholding allowance certificates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ChecklistItem>
                
                <ChecklistItem title="Step 5: Onboard Employees into Your Payroll System" icon={Banknote}>
                   Enter all the information from Step 4 into your chosen payroll provider's system. This includes the employee's name, address, Social Security Number, salary or hourly rate, and tax withholding details from their W-4. Double-check everything for accuracy.
                </ChecklistItem>
                
                <ChecklistItem title="Step 6: Run Your First Payroll" icon={CheckSquare}>
                   Once everything is set up, you are ready to run your first payroll. Your payroll provider will automatically:
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li>Calculate gross pay, all tax withholdings, and net pay.</li>
                        <li>Initiate direct deposits to your employees.</li>
                        <li>Set aside the withheld taxes and your employer-side taxes for payment to the government.</li>
                    </ul>
                    After running payroll, verify in your provider's dashboard that the tax deposits to the IRS and state agencies have been scheduled.
                </ChecklistItem>
