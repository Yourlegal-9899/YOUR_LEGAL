              Missing an IRS deadline is a costly mistake. This guide breaks down the key dates every US business owner needs to know for the 2024 tax year (filed in 2025).

              For business owners, "tax season" isn't just a single day in April. It's a series of critical deadlines that vary based on your company's legal structure. Understanding and meeting these deadlines is a fundamental aspect of US tax compliance. The IRS imposes automatic penalties for late filings, so marking these dates on your calendar is essential for avoiding unnecessary costs.

                <p>What if you need more time? The IRS allows you to file for an automatic six-month extension to file your return.

                        Even if you file an extension, you are still required to estimate your tax liability and pay that amount by the original due date (April 15 for C-Corps).

                 <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>State Income Tax:</strong> Many states have their own corporate income tax returns with deadlines that often, but not always, align with federal dates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Franchise Tax:</strong> States like Delaware have a separate Franchise Tax with a different deadline (March 1 for Delaware C-Corps). This is a tax for the privilege of being incorporated in the state and is due even with no business activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual Reports:</strong> Most states require an Annual Report filing to keep your company's information current. These have their own unique deadlines throughout the year based on your incorporation date.</li>
