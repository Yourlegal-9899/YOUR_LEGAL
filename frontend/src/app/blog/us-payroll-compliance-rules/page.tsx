              Hiring your first employee is a huge milestone. It also triggers a complex set of tax and legal obligations. Here are the core rules you must follow.

              For any business owner, hiring the first employee is a major step toward growth. However, it also marks the company's entry into one of the most complex and high-stakes areas of US business compliance: payroll. The process of paying an employee is far more than just writing a check. It involves a web of federal and state laws that govern tax withholding, reporting, and worker classification.

              Getting payroll wrong can lead to some of the most severe penalties the IRS imposes. This guide breaks down the fundamental rules every founder needs to know before they hire.

            <BlogSection title="The Pillars of Payroll Compliance" icon={Landmark}>
                <ComplianceStep title="1. Get Your Tax IDs in Order" icon={FileText}>
                    <p>Before you can pay anyone, you need to be registered as an employer.</p>
                     <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Federal EIN:</strong> You must have a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS. This is the primary tax ID for your business.</li>
                        <li><strong>State Payroll Tax IDs:</strong> You must register with the tax agency of each state where you have an employee. This is necessary for paying State Unemployment Insurance (SUI) and withholding state income tax.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ComplianceStep>

                 <ComplianceStep title="2. Classify Your Workers Correctly" icon={Users}>
                    <p>This is one of the most critical and high-risk decisions. You must determine if your worker is a W-2 employee or a 1099 independent contractor.</p>
                     <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>W-2 Employee:</strong> Someone over whom you have behavioral and financial control (you direct when, where, and how they work). You must withhold taxes from their pay and pay employer-side payroll taxes.</li>
                        <li><strong>1099 Contractor:</strong> A self-employed individual who controls their own work. You do not withhold taxes from their payments.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p className="mt-2">Misclassifying an employee as a contractor can lead to huge bills for back taxes and penalties. See our guide to <Link href="/blog/payroll-mistakes-irs-penalties" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">common payroll mistakes</Link> for more on this risk.</p>
                </ComplianceStep>
                
                <ComplianceStep title="3. Collect New Hire Paperwork" icon={FileText}>
                    <p>For every W-2 employee, you must collect and keep on file two key forms:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Form W-4:</strong> The employee fills this out to tell you how much federal income tax to withhold from their paycheck based on their filing status and dependents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Form I-9:</strong> This is used to verify the employee's identity and authorization to work in the United States. You must inspect their identity documents and sign this form.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ComplianceStep>
                
                <ComplianceStep title="4. Calculate and Withhold Taxes" icon={Banknote}>
                    <p>Each payday, you are legally required to withhold several types of taxes from an employee's gross pay:</p>
                     <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Federal Income Tax:</strong> Based on the employee's W-4.</li>
                        <li><strong>FICA Taxes:</strong> This includes a 6.2% Social Security tax and a 1.45% Medicare tax. Your business must also pay an equal matching amount.</li>
                        <li><strong>State & Local Income Taxes:</strong> If applicable in the employee's state of work.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ComplianceStep>

                <ComplianceStep title="5. Deposit and Report Payroll Taxes" icon={Landmark}>
                    <p>The taxes you withhold are not your money; you are holding them in trust for the government. You must deposit these funds with the IRS and state agencies on a set schedule (usually semi-weekly or monthly).</p>
                    <p>You must also file regular reports, most commonly <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-941" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Form 941</a> (Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return), to reconcile the taxes you've reported and paid.</p>
