              The United States actively encourages foreign investment and makes it surprisingly straightforward for non-residents to form and own a US company. You do not need a visa, a US address, or a Social Security Number to get started. However, the process for a non-resident founder has several unique hurdles that domestic founders don't face.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3 mt-6">1. The US Address Requirement</h3>
                <p><strong>The Hurdle:</strong> Every US company must have a Registered Agent with a physical address in its state of formation to receive official legal notices. You cannot use a PO Box.</p>
                <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> This is solved by using a commercial Registered Agent service. All of our formation packages include one year of Registered Agent service, instantly satisfying this requirement. We also provide a unique business mailing address for your regular mail.</p>
                
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3 mt-8">2. Obtaining an Employer Identification Number (EIN)</h3>
                <p><strong>The Hurdle:</strong> An EIN is your federal tax ID number, and it is essential for opening a bank account. The online IRS application requires a US Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), which most non-residents don't have.</p>
                <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Non-residents must apply by faxing or mailing Form SS-4 to the IRS. This is a complex, slow process prone to errors. Our team specializes in this. We prepare and submit the SS-4 application correctly on your behalf, acting as your Third-Party Designee to communicate with the IRS and secure your EIN as quickly as possible. Learn more in our <Link href="/blog/ein-itin-explained" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">EIN Guide</Link>.</p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3 mt-8">3. Opening a US Business Bank Account</h3>
                <p><strong>The Hurdle:</strong> Most traditional US banks require founders to visit a branch in person to open an account. For a non-resident, this is a major obstacle.</p>
                <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> We partner with modern banking platforms and fintechs that are built for global founders and allow for remote account opening. With your new company documents and EIN, we provide support and introductions to help you apply for an account with these partners, allowing you to manage your US finances from anywhere.</p>
