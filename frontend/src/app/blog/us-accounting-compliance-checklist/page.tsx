              For new founders, the term "accounting compliance" can sound intimidating. It brings to mind complex regulations and the fear of making a costly mistake. However, at its core, accounting compliance is simply the process of setting up and maintaining a financial system that is accurate, reliable, and adheres to the rules set by authorities like the IRS.
            </p>
             <p className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
              Getting this right from the start is one of the most important things a founder can do. A compliant accounting system is not just about avoiding penalties; it's about building the financial backbone that enables smart decision-making, inspires investor confidence, and supports scalable growth. This checklist breaks down the essential steps to achieve accounting compliance for your US company.

            <BlogSection title="The Accounting Compliance Checklist" icon={BookOpen}>
                <ChecklistItem title="Step 1: Set Up a Separate Business Bank Account">
                  This is the non-negotiable first step. Never use your personal bank account for business transactions. Commingling funds "pierces the corporate veil," exposing your personal assets to business liabilities, and makes accurate bookkeeping impossible. Open a dedicated <Link href="/usa/company-formation" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">US business bank account</Link> as soon as you have your EIN.
                </ChecklistItem>
                
                <ChecklistItem title="Step 2: Choose an Accounting Method">
                    You must decide whether to use the cash or accrual basis for your books. While the IRS permits small businesses to use cash basis, **accrual basis is the standard required by US GAAP** and is the only method investors and lenders will accept. For any scalable business, choosing accrual from the start is the correct decision. Learn more in our <Link href="/blog/usa-gaap-vs-cash-accounting" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">GAAP vs. Cash Accounting</Link> guide.
                </ChecklistItem>

                <ChecklistItem title="Step 3: Establish a Chart of Accounts (COA)">
                    This is the "skeleton" of your financial system. A COA is a complete list of all the financial accounts in your general ledger, organized by type: Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, and Expenses. A well-structured COA is essential for generating meaningful financial reports. A professional <Link href="/usa/bookkeeping" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">bookkeeping service</Link> will set this up for you according to industry best practices.
                </ChecklistItem>

                <ChecklistItem title="Step 4: Record All Transactions with Source Documents">
                    Every transaction—every sale, every expense, every transfer—must be recorded in your accounting system. Crucially, each record must be supported by a source document (a receipt, an invoice, a bank statement). The IRS requires this as proof for deductions. A credit card statement alone is not sufficient. Use software that allows you to attach a digital copy of the source document to each transaction.
                </ChecklistItem>

                 <ChecklistItem title="Step 5: Reconcile Your Accounts Monthly">
                    At the end of each month, you must perform a bank reconciliation. This is the process of matching the transactions in your accounting system to the transactions on your bank and credit card statements. This ensures your books are accurate and catches any errors, fraudulent charges, or missed transactions promptly.
                </ChecklistItem>

                <ChecklistItem title="Step 6: Generate Regular Financial Statements">
                    Your accounting system should produce the "Big Three" financial statements at least monthly:
                     <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>**Income Statement (P&L):** Shows your profitability.</li>
                        <li>**Balance Sheet:** Shows your financial position.</li>
                        <li>**Statement of Cash Flows:** Shows how cash moves through your business.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Reviewing these statements regularly is fundamental to understanding your business's health and making informed strategic decisions.
                </ChecklistItem>
                
                 <ChecklistItem title="Step 7: Adhere to Record Retention Policies">
                    The IRS requires you to keep financial records for a minimum period. The general rule is **three years** from the date you file your tax return. However, this extends to **six years** if you substantially underreport income. For records related to assets, it's best to keep them for as long as you own the asset plus at least three years. A safe bet is to keep all key records for at least seven years.
