              Beyond the April 15 tax day, several other lesser-known deadlines carry huge penalties. Here are the critical dates that every founder must know.

             Most founders know about the April 15th tax deadline. But in the complex world of US corporate compliance, it's often the deadlines you *don't* know about that pose the biggest threat. Several mandatory filings have unique due dates and carry disproportionately large, automatic penalties for non-compliance.

            <p className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
             For international founders and busy entrepreneurs, missing these dates is a common and costly mistake. This guide highlights the top three most-missed deadlines and the severe consequences of overlooking them.

            <BlogSection title="The High-Stakes Deadlines" icon={Calendar}>
                <DeadlineHighlight
                    title="1. Delaware Franchise Tax"
                    deadline="March 1st for C-Corps"
                    penalty="$200 late penalty plus 1.5% monthly interest."
                >
                    <p>This is arguably the most frequently missed deadline by new startups. A C-Corporation incorporated in Delaware **must** file its Annual Report and pay Franchise Tax by March 1st. This has nothing to do with your IRS income tax filing. It is a separate state-level obligation.</p>
                    <p className="mt-2">The late penalty is an automatic $200, plus interest. If you remain non-compliant, Delaware will revoke your company's "Good Standing" status and can eventually dissolve it. See our guide to <Link href="/blog/annual-reports-and-franchise-taxes" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Annual Reports and Franchise Taxes</Link> for more.</p>

                 <DeadlineHighlight
                    title="2. Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) Report"
                    deadline="Within 30/90 days of formation (for new companies)"
                    penalty="$500 per day (up to $10,000) and potential criminal charges."
                >
                    <p>The BOI Report is a new, mandatory federal filing with FinCEN required under the Corporate Transparency Act. The deadlines are extremely tight for new companies:</p>
                     <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>Companies formed in 2024 have **90 days** from their formation date to file.</li>
                        <li>Companies formed from 2025 onwards will have only **30 days**.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="mt-2">Because this is a new requirement and the deadline is so close to formation, it is very easy to miss. The penalties are deliberately severe to ensure compliance. For a full breakdown, see our <Link href="/blog/boi-reporting-requirements-explained" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">BOI Reporting Guide</Link>.</p>

                <DeadlineHighlight
                    title="3. Form 5472 for Foreign-Owned LLCs"
                    deadline="April 15th (same as C-Corp tax return)"
                    penalty="A flat $25,000."
                >
                    <p>This is the most dangerous trap for non-resident founders. A single-member LLC owned by a non-resident is a "disregarded entity" for most tax purposes, but it has a strict informational filing requirement with the IRS.</p>
                     <p className="mt-2">The company must file Form 5472 to report any "reportable transactions" with its foreign owner (including the initial capital contribution). This form is attached to a pro-forma Form 1120 and is due by April 15th. The penalty for failing to file is not a percentage; it's an automatic **$25,000**.
