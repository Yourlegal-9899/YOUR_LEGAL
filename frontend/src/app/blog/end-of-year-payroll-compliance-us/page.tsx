              As the calendar year closes, employers have a critical set of payroll tasks and deadlines to meet. This checklist breaks down everything you need to do to stay compliant with the IRS.

              For US employers, the end of the calendar year isn't just a time for holiday parties; it's the start of the most critical period for payroll compliance. This is when businesses must reconcile their entire year of payroll data, file annual reports with the IRS, and provide employees and contractors with the tax forms they need to file their personal returns.
            </p>
             <p className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
              Missing these deadlines or providing inaccurate information can lead to significant IRS penalties and frustrated employees. Following a structured checklist is the best way to ensure a smooth and compliant year-end process.

                  Before you can file anything, you need to ensure your data is correct. Garbage in, garbage out.

                        <li><strong>Employee Information:</strong> Confirm all employee names, addresses, and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) are correct. Mismatched names and SSNs are a common cause of filing rejections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Company Information:</strong> Verify that your company's legal name, address, and Employer Identification Number (EIN) are accurate in your payroll system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wage & Tax Data:</strong> Review year-to-date wage, tax, and benefits information for each employee to catch any discrepancies before final reports are generated.</li>

                        <li><strong>Form 941 (Q4):</strong> File your final quarterly payroll report for the fourth quarter (October-December).</li>
                        <li><strong>Form 940 (Annual):</strong> File your annual Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) return. This reconciles your FUTA tax liability for the entire year.</li>

                        <li><strong>Form W-2 for Employees:</strong> Every W-2 employee must be sent their Form W-2, which summarizes their total wages and tax withholdings for the year. You must also file a copy of all W-2s with the Social Security Administration by this date.</li>
                        <li><strong>Form 1099-NEC for Contractors:</strong> If you paid an independent contractor $600 or more during the year, you must send them a Form 1099-NEC. You must also file a copy with the IRS.</li>
