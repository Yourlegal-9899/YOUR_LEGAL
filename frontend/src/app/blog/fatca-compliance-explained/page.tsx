              The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a landmark piece of US legislation enacted in 2010 to combat offshore tax evasion by US citizens and residents. It creates a global reporting regime, compelling foreign banks and financial institutions to report on the accounts of their US clients to the IRS. For individuals and businesses with international ties, understanding FATCA is a critical piece of the <Link href="/usa/tax-compliance" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">US tax compliance</Link> puzzle.
            </p>
            <p className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
              This guide will explain the two main components of FATCA and clarify who needs to report what.
            </p>

            <BlogSection title="Part 1: Reporting by Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs)" icon={Landmark}>
                <p>The first part of FATCA requires Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs)—such as foreign banks, brokerages, and investment funds—to enter into an agreement with the IRS. Under this agreement, they must:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li>Identify financial accounts held by US taxpayers or by foreign entities in which US taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest.</li>
                    <li>Report information about these accounts, including the account holder's name, address, US Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), account balance, and income, to the IRS annually.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most countries have signed Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) with the US, which facilitates this reporting through their own national tax authorities. This is why when you open a bank account outside the US, you are often asked to certify whether you are a "US Person."</p>
            </BlogSection>
            
            <BlogSection title="Part 2: Reporting by US Taxpayers (Form 8938)" icon={FileText}>
                <p>The second part of FATCA directly affects US taxpayers themselves. If you are a US person and hold foreign financial assets with an aggregate value above a certain threshold, you must report these assets to the IRS by filing <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Form 8938</a>, "Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets," with your annual income tax return.</p>
                
                <h3 className="font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Who is a "US Person"?</h3>
                <p>This includes US citizens, US residents (Green Card holders or those who meet the Substantial Presence Test), and certain US entities like domestic corporations and partnerships.</p>
                
                <h3 className="font-bold mt-6 mb-2">What are "Specified Foreign Financial Assets"?</h3>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li>Financial accounts maintained by a foreign financial institution (bank accounts, brokerage accounts).</li>
                    <li>Stock or securities issued by a non-US person.</li>
                    <li>Any other financial instrument or contract held for investment that has a non-US issuer or counterparty.</li>
                </ul>
                
                 <h3 className="font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Filing Thresholds:</h3>
                 <p>The requirement to file Form 8938 depends on where you live and your filing status. For a single taxpayer living in the US, you must file if the total value of your specified foreign financial assets is more than $50,000 on the last day of the tax year or more than $75,000 at any time during the year. These thresholds are higher for married couples and for taxpayers living abroad.</p>

            <BlogSection title="FATCA vs. FBAR: What's the Difference?" icon={AlertTriangle}>
                <p>This is a major source of confusion. FATCA (Form 8938) reporting is separate from, and in addition to, the FBAR (FinCEN Form 114) filing requirement. They are filed with different government agencies and have different rules.</p>
