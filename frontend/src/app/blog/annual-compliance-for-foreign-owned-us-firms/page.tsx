              Beyond standard filings, the IRS has a special set of rules for non-resident owners. Understanding Form 5472 and FBAR is not just important—it's critical.

              While a foreign-owned US company is subject to all the same <Link href="/blog/us-annual-compliance-checklist" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">annual compliance</Link> requirements as a domestic one, it also faces an additional layer of scrutiny and reporting from the IRS and other federal agencies. These rules are designed to provide the US government with visibility into the financial activities of non-residents and to prevent tax evasion.

             <p className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
              For international founders, these extra filings are the most significant compliance risk they face. The penalties for non-compliance are not just fines; they are designed to be punitive. This guide breaks down the critical annual compliance obligations specific to foreign-owned US firms.
            </p>

            <BlogSection title="The Extra Layers of Foreign-Owned Compliance" icon={Globe}>
                <Requirement title="1. Form 5472: The Big One" icon={FileWarning}>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> This is the most important compliance requirement for most foreign founders. Form 5472 is an informational return filed with the IRS to report transactions between a 25% foreign-owned US company and its foreign owners or related parties.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who Must File:</strong> Any US C-Corp with a 25% or greater foreign shareholder that had a reportable transaction, AND **all foreign-owned single-member LLCs**, which are treated as "disregarded entities" and must file Form 5472 with a pro-forma Form 1120.</p>
                    <p><strong>What's a Reportable Transaction?</strong> It's incredibly broad. It includes the initial capital contribution from the owner to the company's bank account, any subsequent loans, payments for services, expense reimbursements, etc.</p>
                    <p className="font-bold mt-2">The Penalty: A flat $25,000 for failure to file, which is automatically assessed. Ignorance is not an excuse. See our detailed <Link href="/blog/cross-border-compliance-guide/non-resident-tax-guide" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Non-Resident Tax Guide</Link> for more.</p>
                </Requirement>

                 <Requirement title="2. FBAR (FinCEN Form 114): Reporting Foreign Accounts" icon={Landmark}>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The FBAR is not an IRS form; it's filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). It is required if a US entity has a financial interest in or signature authority over foreign financial accounts with an aggregate value that exceeded $10,000 at any point during the year.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who Must File:</strong> This often applies to US holding companies with foreign subsidiaries that have their own bank accounts, or US companies that maintain accounts with foreign fintechs like Wise or Revolut.</p>
                    <p className="font-bold mt-2">The Penalty: Penalties for willful failure to file can be extreme, potentially up to $100,000 or 50% of the account balance.</p>
                </Requirement>

                <Requirement title="3. Form 1042: Withholding Tax on Payments to Foreign Persons" icon={Shield}>
                    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> If your US company makes certain types of payments to foreign individuals or entities (including its owners), it may be required to withhold US tax and remit it to the IRS. This is reported on Form 1042.</p>
                    <p><strong>Common Payments Requiring Withholding:</strong></p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>Dividends paid from a C-Corp to a foreign shareholder.</li>
                        <li>Interest paid on a loan from a foreign owner.</li>
                        <li>Royalty payments for intellectual property.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="mt-2">The standard withholding rate is 30%, but this can often be reduced by a tax treaty between the US and the owner's home country.</p>
                    <p className="font-bold mt-2">The Penalty: Failure to withhold and remit the correct amount of tax can result in the company being held liable for the unpaid tax, plus penalties and interest.</p>
                </Requirement>
