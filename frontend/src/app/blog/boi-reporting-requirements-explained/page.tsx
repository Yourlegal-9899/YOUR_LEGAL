              The Corporate Transparency Act introduced a major new filing requirement for US companies. Understanding your BOI report obligation is not optional—it's mandatory.

              Effective January 1, 2024, the landscape of US corporate compliance changed dramatically. The introduction of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) brought a new, mandatory filing requirement for millions of small businesses: the Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) Report. This new rule, designed to combat illicit financial activities, requires most US companies to report detailed information about their owners and those who control them to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

             <p className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
              For founders, especially non-residents, understanding and complying with this new regulation is critical. The penalties for failure to file are severe. This guide breaks down exactly what the BOI report is, who needs to file it, what information is required, and when it's due.
            </p>

            <BlogSection title="What is the BOI Report?" icon={FileText}>
                <p>The BOI Report is a mandatory filing that provides FinCEN with details about a company's "beneficial owners." A beneficial owner is any individual who, directly or indirectly, either exercises "substantial control" over the company or owns/controls at least 25% of the ownership interests.</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Substantial Control:</strong> This is a broad definition and includes senior officers (like the CEO or President), individuals with the authority to appoint or remove senior officers, and anyone who is an important decision-maker for the company.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ownership Interest:</strong> This includes equity, stock, voting rights, convertible instruments, and any other mechanism used to establish ownership.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-4">Essentially, the government wants to know which real people are behind the corporate entity.</p>
            </BlogSection>
            
             <BlogSection title="Who Must File a BOI Report?" icon={UserCheck}>
                <p>The rule applies to most US business entities. You are likely required to file if your company is:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li>A C-Corporation or LLC created by filing a document with a secretary of state.</li>
                    <li>A foreign company registered to do business in any US state.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-4">There are 23 specific exemptions, but they mostly apply to large, highly regulated companies like public companies, banks, and insurance firms. **Nearly all startups, small businesses, and holding companies must file a BOI report.**</p>
            </BlogSection>

            <BlogSection title="What Information Must Be Reported?" icon={Shield}>
                <p>The report requires specific details for both the company and each of its beneficial owners.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold mt-6 mb-2">For the Company:</h4>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>Full legal name and any trade names (DBA).</li>
                    <li>Current US address.</li>
                    <li>Jurisdiction of formation.</li>
                    <li>Employer Identification Number (EIN).</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 className="font-bold mt-6 mb-2">For Each Beneficial Owner:</h4>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li>Full legal name, date of birth, and residential address.</li>
                    <li>A unique identifying number from an acceptable identification document (e.g., a non-expired passport for foreign nationals).</li>
                    <li>An image of that identification document.</li>
                </ul>
            </BlogSection>

            <BlogSection title="Deadlines & Penalties: Why This Matters" icon={AlertTriangle}>
                <p>The deadlines for filing are strict and depend on when your company was formed.</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li>Companies created **before January 1, 2024**, must file their initial report by **January 1, 2025**.</li>
                    <li>Companies created **during 2024** must file their report within **90 calendar days** of their formation.</li>
                    <li>Companies created **on or after January 1, 2025**, must file within **30 calendar days** of formation.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h4 className="font-bold text-red-800 flex items-center mb-2">Severe Penalties for Non-Compliance</h4>
                    <p className="text-red-700">The penalties for willfully failing to file or providing false information are draconian: civil penalties of up to **$500 per day** for each day the violation continues, and potential criminal penalties including up to **two years of imprisonment** and a fine of up to $10,000.</p>
