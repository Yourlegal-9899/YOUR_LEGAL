              After navigating the <Link href="/blog/us-company-formation-process" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">company formation process</Link>, many founders breathe a sigh of relief. But the work of building a compliant business has just begun. The period immediately following incorporation is the most critical time to establish your company's financial infrastructure.

             <p className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
              Setting up your accounting system correctly from day one will save you countless hours of cleanup, thousands of dollars in potential tax overpayments, and immense stress down the road. A proper setup ensures you meet all <Link href="/blog/us-bookkeeping-requirements" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">bookkeeping requirements</Link> and are ready for tax season and investor due diligence. This guide provides a 5-step checklist for your post-incorporation accounting setup.
            </p>

            <BlogSection title="The Accounting Setup Checklist" icon={CheckSquare}>
                <Step number={1} title="Open a Dedicated US Business Bank Account">
                    <p>This is the most important first step. **Do not mix business and personal funds.** Commingling funds pierces the corporate veil, destroying your liability protection. Open a dedicated business bank account as soon as you have your formation documents and EIN. All company revenue must go into this account, and all business expenses must be paid from it.</p>
                </Step>
                
                <Step number={2} title="Choose and Set Up Accounting Software">
                    <p>Spreadsheets are not a scalable or compliant accounting system. You need professional cloud accounting software. The industry leaders are QuickBooks Online and Xero. This software will be the central hub for all your financial data. Our <Link href="/usa/bookkeeping" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">bookkeeping services</Link> are built on these platforms.</p>
                </Step>

                <Step number={3} title="Establish Your Chart of Accounts (COA)">
                    <p>The COA is the backbone of your accounting system. It is a list of all the categories you will use to classify your financial transactions. A well-structured COA, based on US GAAP, is essential for generating accurate financial statements. A typical COA includes categories for:</p>
                     <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>Assets (e.g., Bank Accounts, Accounts Receivable)</li>
                        <li>Liabilities (e.g., Credit Cards, Loans Payable)</li>
                        <li>Equity (e.g., Owner's Investment, Retained Earnings)</li>
                        <li>Revenue (e.g., Product Sales, Service Fees)</li>
                        <li>Expenses (e.g., Software, Marketing, Salaries)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A professional accountant can set up an industry-standard COA for you.</p>
                </Step>

                <Step number={4} title="Connect Bank Feeds">
                    <p>Modern accounting relies on automation. Connect your new business bank account and credit cards to your accounting software. This will automatically import all your transactions every day, eliminating most manual data entry and ensuring no transaction is missed. This is a core feature of an automated bookkeeping system.</p>
                </Step>

                 <Step number={5} title="Create a System for Receipt Management">
                    <p>For every expense you claim as a tax deduction, the IRS requires proof. A bank transaction alone is not enough; you need a detailed receipt or invoice. Use software that allows you to capture and attach a digital copy of the receipt to each transaction in your accounting system. Apps like Dext or the built-in features of QuickBooks Online make this easy. Make it a weekly habit to photograph and upload all receipts.</p>
                </Step>
