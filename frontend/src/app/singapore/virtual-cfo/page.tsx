            <ContentSection title="Strategic & Compliance Risks">
                <p>Scaling a business in the competitive APAC region without senior financial leadership is a significant strategic risk. It can lead to:</p>

                    <li>**Uncontrolled Cash Burn:** Running out of capital due to poor cash flow forecasting, which is particularly dangerous when operating across multiple currencies.</li>
                    <li>**Failed Fundraising Efforts:** Inability to provide regional VCs with the sophisticated financial models, cohort analysis, and data they expect during due diligence.</li>
                    <li>**Poor Unit Economics:** Lack of analysis on Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Lifetime Value (LTV) for different APAC markets, leading to unprofitable growth strategies.</li>
                    <li>**Inefficient Tax Structuring:** Failure to leverage Singapore's tax treaties and holding company regime, resulting in unnecessary tax leakage from foreign subsidiaries.</li>
                </ul>
