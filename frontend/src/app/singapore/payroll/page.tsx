             <ContentSection title="When It Is Required">
                <p>A compliant payroll system is required from your very first local hire. Employers must make CPF contributions for any employee earning more than S$50 per month. These contributions must be paid by the 14th day of the following month.</p>

            <ContentSection title="Cost Ranges">
                <p>Professional payroll services in Singapore are typically priced per employee:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Per Employee, Per Month:** S$30 – S$70.</li>
                    <li>**Additional services:** Fees may be higher for processing tax clearance for foreign employees (Form IR21).</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

            <ContentSection title="Compliance Risks">
                <p>The CPF Board strictly enforces contribution requirements. Failure to comply leads to:</p>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>**Late Payment Interest:** Interest is charged on late CPF contributions, calculated daily.</li>
                    <li>**Fines and Penalties:** The CPF Board can impose fines and take legal action against employers who fail to pay contributions.</li>
                    <li>**Director Liability:** Directors can be held personally liable for the company's unpaid CPF contributions.</li>
                </ul>
            </ContentSection>

             <ContentSection title="Why Outsourcing Works Better">
                <p>CPF contribution rates are complex, varying based on an employee's age and residency status.

We manage the entire process, from calculating contributions and issuing itemized payslips (a legal requirement) to ensuring timely payment to the CPF Board, safeguarding your business from significant financial penalties.</p>
